.app {
  // these edits will work - i gave it max height of the screen size, and added border box so that if you add borders or something it doesnt scroll

  // also if you want to have a gap between rows you can use the grid-gap property(?) and set it that way not using a whole row.

  // if i had to do this though i would do it the way that i added below. then i would set any inner grids on their own within the body.

  // display: grid;
  // grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  // grid-template-rows: 1fr 12fr 1fr;
  // max-height: 100vh;
  // box-sizing: border-box;
  // gap: 10px;
  // .header {
  //   grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2;
  //   background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  // }

  // .main {
  //   background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  //   grid-area: 2 / 1 / 3 / 2;
  // }

  // .footer {
  //   background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  //   grid-area: 3 / 1 / 4 / 2;
  // }

  display: grid;
  grid-auto-flow: row; // change direction of the grid from column to row, so top to bottom
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  align-content: space-between;
  height: 100vh; // vh is basically the percentage of the screen so 100vh is 100% of the vertical area - vw does the same for width
  box-sizing: border-box; // i added this because i was using borders before i realised that firefox will do that for you if you click grid in inspect, unlike chrome the lines stay there even if you navigate away.
